# Chat Bot

Here we have created a **deep learning AI model** which can answer the users query more efficiently. The bot takes the users input and classifies the text into one of the several categories and gives the reply according to the category it is based on.

**The libraries used in this program are as followed as:**
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- spaCY


While creating the model all kinds of **data engineering / data preprocessing** are done using the spaCY libaries. Steps done while data preprocessing are as followed:

- Lemmainzation
- Stop words
- Tokenization


After the model is created we have implemented the uses of model in **bot.py** program. All the method done in this program are as followed:

- Importing the model
- Taking user input
- Converting the user input into numereic format
- Predicting the reply to the queries
